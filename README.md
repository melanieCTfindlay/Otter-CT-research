# Otter-CT-research
Data and code derived from  camera-trapping sites of otter resting sites on 
the River Tweed catchment.

This repository contains four R files and six csv files. 
Each R file runs independantly from the other R files to create the four plots
for Figure 4-11 and 4-12 within my thesis.
Each R file requires all the csv files to run.

The two R files SINGLE PERIOD PLOT & DUAL PERIOD PLOT, run simulations on 
winter-spring periods of camera-trapping at individual sites
to find the minimum camera trap sampling period for each site which would 
have a 95% chance of detecting a rest by an otter.

The two R files SINGLE NULL PERIOD PLOT & DUAL NULL PERIOD PLOT show the proportion
of sampling periods rejected as they did not detect a rest and where the camera
traps failed to function at least 6 out of 7 days.
